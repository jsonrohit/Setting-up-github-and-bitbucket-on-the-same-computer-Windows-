# Setting up a seperate Github and Bitbucket account

If you want to have private repositories at Bitbucket and public repositories at 
Github, then this is the guide for you. Your life is obviously simpler if you can
afford Github but I cannot afford it and so this guide was created.

This guide assumes: 

+ Git is set up for a single github user using https, not ssh 
+ There is only a *known_hosts* file in `~/.ssh/`
+ The computer is running Mac OSX 10.7 or greater
+ You already have an account at [Github](http://www.github.com) and another at [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org)
